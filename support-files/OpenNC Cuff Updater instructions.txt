This the latest OpenNC cuff code released.
This updater will update your old OpenCollar / OpenCuffs scripted cuffs to the latest OpenNC code.
This will clear your Owner lists in your cuffs, but if you have the "OpenCollar - cuffs - 3.941" in your collar they will automatically update themselves. Just drop the enclosed script in to an unlocked collar (or you will be blocked by RLV restrictions) for your cuffs to sync to your collar (you may need to remove your collar and then wear it again to kick off the first sync to your cuffs).

1) rez the OpenNC cuff Updater on the ground.
2) rez your right wrist (forearm) cuff on to the ground near the updater.
3) drag and drop the enclosed OpenNC Update script into your cuff.
4) say "UPDATE" (without the quotes and in capitals), in local chat. You should get a confirmation box up (press yes)
    If you do not get a confirmation box up AND you do not get an error message in local chat, then say "YES" in Local chat(some very old cuffs will not display this box - gaslight cuffs as an example).
    You only need to drop in the OpenNC Update script into your cuff for the first time, once updated to OpenNC 3.950 or above, your cuffs will keep the updater script. Unless you want to add support for wings or tail cuffs/chains, just press Start and wait... take a couple of sips of your drink, and it should be about finished.
5) Once finished, your cuff will reset and you may pick it up and wear it. Your Cuff set will now sync to your OpenCollar collar, and will look like your OpenCollar collar's menu system.

Most menu's can be accessed by adding a 'c' - ie 
<pre>cmenu for the cuffs main menu.
<pre>cpose for the pose main nemu
<pre>a:<arm pose name>
<pre>l:<leg pose name>


******NOTE******
This updater will not update your other slave cuffs, at the time of writing you need to manually replace the root prim files. With out doing so you may sometimes have your slave cuffs not lock when worn, this is a bug within SL/Viewers RLV replies.
